## 🏹 Problem

`YouTube` is a great platform for learning anything, you can find tons of programming tutorial on almost any topic. Some `YouTube` videos are better than paid courses, but the problem is when you start learning from `YouTube` you end up watching tons of unrelated videos. 

Most often when we watch any programming tutorial on youtube, we get stuck on a problem and there is no one to help. You look into the comments but to be honest most of them are shitty. If this platform didn't exist, I would have gave up on the project. 

## 💡 Solution

The website that I'm presenting to you is highly useful for the students who are learning to code. 

* You can enroll in hand-picked best courses from Youtube.
* Now once you're enrolled, you can watch the video, take notes and discuss with other peers on the platform.
* Here you can ask doubts in the doubts panel and have chitchat in the discussions. 
* You can also see what others have built in the projects section.
