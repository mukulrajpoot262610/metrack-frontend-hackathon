## üèπ Problem

Youtube has enough resources to learn any skill online. But it's not at all collaborative and you can't track what you're learning. Particularly for developers, it is very important to follow a defined roadmap, get peer support through online discussions, and be able to see what others are building.

But, all you get there is unorganized random chats. **Youtube is full of unorganized resources.**

## üí° Idea
The idea is to build a collaborative website where people can share their projects and get real-time feedback. They should also be able to discuss all the minor doubts and errors that one gets while watching a coding tutorial. So, you don't lack motivation and give up on your project eventually.

Don't forget, engagement with the community is very important to learn any skill faster.

## üí° Solution
MeTrack is a website where you can find top-rated tech videos and tutorials in the form of a course.

This is how we solve this problem for our fellow developers who are learning to code.

* Hand-picked youtube tutorials for developers.

* Peer support: Realtime discussion panel to ask your doubts.

* See the projects others have built by following the tutorial.

* Building in public: Upload your projects and get feedback from others.

* Proof of Work: Show your profile to potential clients and recruiters to grab the opportunity.

In other words,

MeTrack helps you sail through the endless ocean of tech resources on YouTube.
